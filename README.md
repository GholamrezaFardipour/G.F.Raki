We worked with X-rays and studied the effect of the X-ray on CMOS.
Using 12 Megapixel official Raspberry Pi CMOS camera to take Raw image files. We did not use any lenz. The size of the captured file is around 30 Mb with DNG format. 
To do this analysis, I convert the DNG format to BMP simply with the Windows Paint software. This software doesn't make any process on the bray file and just changes the format.
Also, the size of the target file will be fixed to equal the maximum size of around 36 Mb.
Here we aim to get these values from the 12-pixel image file:
"Maximum of the group's area"
"Maximum of the group's value"
"Average of the group's Area"
"Average of the group's values"
"number of the groups"
each group means a spot in the image.
